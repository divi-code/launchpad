The first virtual coin has launched an enormous transformation of the way we can pay for services buy goods and opened for us lots of opportunities to gain money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distributed ledger technology, like blockchain, is one of the innovations that have opened floodgates to multiple ways to invest. Such technology allows you to tokenize any property, like art, company shares, buildings, funds, services, equity, etc. So what is tokenization, and what are tokenized assets? Let\u2019s discover.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Tokenization: Definitions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although tokenization may sound complex, it is actually quite simple. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hedera.com\/learning\/what-is-asset-tokenization#:~:text=Asset%20tokenization%20is%20the%20process,either%20digital%20or%20physical%20assets.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenization of assets<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the process of creating digital tokens representing digital or physical assets on a distributed ledger or blockchain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, tokenized assets is the process of generating an informatic code that presents the key characteristics of an asset, exposing some functions that allow the user to interact with the digital representation of that asset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology guarantees that once you own tokens of an asset, no one else can be the owner of the chosen property.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are Tokenized Assets?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/assets.ey.com\/content\/dam\/ey-sites\/ey-com\/en_ch\/topics\/blockchain\/ey-tokenization-of-assets-broschure-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital token<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be defined as a piece of software with a unique reference to an asset, properties, and\/or legal rights. Despite the fact that similar pieces of software can be created, the fact that a token runs on Blockchain distinguishes it from other digitalization methods. Due to the blockchain technology allowing to make a digital token, different companies can collaborate. Thus, all parties can update and check information seamlessly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two types of tokenized assets: fungible and non-fungible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fungible tokenized assets are interchangeable, meaning they can be exchanged one with another of the same kind as an essential asset feature.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another characteristic of fungible tokens is divisible, so it\u2019s possible to buy a decimal place of the asset. For example, the famous cryptocurrency <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/eth\/#:~:text=ETH%20is%20divisible%20up%20to,0.000000000000000001%20ETH%20if%20you%20want.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum (ETH)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be divided into 18 decimal places. Therefore, it makes it possible to buy not the whole coin but its part (up to 0.000000000000000001 ETH).<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-fungible tokenized assets (widely known as NFTs), contrary to the fungible, can\u2019t be interchanged or replaced with assets of the same type because each NFT is unique. Also, they are unique and non-divisible.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advantages of the tokenization<\/span><b><\/b><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Low risk from data breaches<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tokenization process protects businesses from the adverse financial effects of a data breach. It is unlikely that any valuable personal data will be stolen, even if a breach occurs. Even though <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fisglobal.com\/en\/insights\/merchant-solutions-worldpay\/article\/4-reasons-to-use-tokenization\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tokenization<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can&#8217;t protect your company from a data breach, it can reduce the financial impact on your company in the event of one.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Reduced Cost<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By automating, keeping clear records, and using the public internet, it&#8217;s possible to reduce costs significantly, with blockchain lowering bond issuance costs by up to 90% and fundraising costs by up to 40% compared with the traditional private placement.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Improved Liquidity<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private equity and real estate are believed to be worth <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/info.polymath.network\/blog\/introduction-to-tokenization-the-benefits-it-brings-and-how-it-works\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$4 trillion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Still, tokenization provides a way to trade previously illiquid or non-fractionable assets (like private placements and real estate) to a global investor pool.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Customers trust<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/retail.emarketer.com\/article\/loss-of-consumer-trust-costly\/5b60d04bebd40005bc4dc73d\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statistics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, many people stop trusting the company if their data is hacked. Therefore, tokenization represents a perfect security tool that fosters customer trust, as it protects from server attacks.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Greenlight to your business<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenization facilitates the process of meeting and maintaining regulatory compliance. The key point is that leading payment technology companies offer tokenization as part of their payment processing services. Thus, you can focus on growing your business while your payment partner reduces the amount of red tape to help you remain compliant.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Payment innovations progress<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokenization is increasingly becoming the predominant payment method for in-store payments from customers&#8217; mobile devices. Mobile wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay store consumers&#8217; credit card information as a token. Smartphones themselves offer additional security through biometric authentication and other advanced security features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By tokenizing payments, eCommerce becomes safer, and user experiences improve-whether online, on mobile, or in-app.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are Synthetic Assets?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term \u2013 Synthetics is a set of financial instruments that are made to ape other instruments while varying key characteristics, including duration &amp; cash flow. Synthetic Assets traditionally combine derivative products \u2014 futures &amp; swaps; or options that simulate fundamental assets like stocks, currencies, commodities, indexes, bonds, or interest rates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Do They Work?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we wrote earlier, synths simulate the value of the fundamental assets. Also, they track the fundamental assets\u2019 value and make it feasible to access these assets to individuals deprived of having them. The variety of Synthetics is presently limited to 2 types:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/btc-alpha.com\/en\/stories\/what-are-synthetic-assets-and-how-do-they-work\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normal Synths<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Positively correlated with fundamental assets)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/btc-alpha.com\/en\/stories\/what-are-synthetic-assets-and-how-do-they-work\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inverse Synths<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Negatively correlated with fundamental assets)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Challenges Do They Face?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all their novel potential &amp; ideals, Synthetic Assets in the modern market also have their share of roadblocks &amp; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/xcarnival-lab.medium.com\/what-are-the-challenges-with-synthetic-assets-fa7768577f18\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">challenges<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to mass adoption. Now, let us discuss some of these:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Limited Scope:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Presently, investors can trade in only a limited number of assets such as Synthetix or UMA.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lack of Attention<\/b><b>:<\/b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, already existing synthetics do not catch our attention. Even the US stocks have hardly received prominence since the investors have various high-volatile choices in cryptocurrencies.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lack of Retail Market<\/b><b>:<\/b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The synthetic market requires multiple transactions to work out for retail users. Often, the investors who enter synthetic markets are from the mining community, who enjoy their incentives and not the customers that the product team envisioned.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Difficult to Scale Participation:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Routinely, large &amp; potential investors enjoy direct access to the synthetic market, whereas smaller investors are deprived of this access.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are There Any Possible Solutions?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After understanding the challenges of Synthetic Assets, now it is time for us to go through the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/xcarnival-lab.medium.com\/what-are-the-challenges-with-synthetic-assets-fa7768577f18\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solutions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for them. From making the access of synthetic assets more decorative and offering extra incentives for development, we require them all. A more liquid market for synthetic assets that is gamified to boost participation and open to all the investors with less or no industry knowledge \u2014 is the catalyst that the sector needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, it is important for the markets to be able to trade in a more extensive number of Synthetic assets and attract more investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summing Up<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synths simulate the value of the basic assets (like stocks &amp; bonds) and track their value to make them feasible &amp; accessible to fresh investors as well. Although in this process, we are facing various challenges such as <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">limited entry, complex nature, and difficult to scale participation. However, if a liquid market is created for this asset class, it would help expand the reach and scope.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is tokenization, and what are tokenized assets?

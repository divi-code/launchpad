We also aim to provide sustainable incentives for our stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>Our exchange is built on the foundation of two essential user groups: market-makers\/LPs and traders who need liquidity.<\/p>\n<p>For market-makers, we offer:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rebates, with every maker order, rewarded 1 basis point<\/li>\n<li>Zero gas cost, covered by the taker fee<\/li>\n<li>Lightning-fast execution (less than 100 ms), providing a predictable trading environment<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For traders, we provide:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low fees, with taker fees starting at 5 basis points and as low as 1.5 basis points<\/li>\n<li>No hidden costs, such as gas fees, included in the taker fee<\/li>\n<li>A powerful trading terminal for informed decision-making<\/li>\n<li>A referral and Robinhood program<\/li>\n<li>Exciting trading competitions and much more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Our fundamental<strong><em> user proposition<\/em> <\/strong>is situated around following pillars:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ultra fast execution. Having a custom built Dexilon Chain allows us to guarantee a very high TPS and blocktime, without the risk of congestion<\/li>\n<li>Limit order rebates &#8211; every limit order filled will be compensated 0.01% for providing liquidity<\/li>\n<li>Ulta low and transparent fees for Taker Order. Suits very well for retail and professional takers. We are 30% cheaper than major CEXs and up to 100% cheaper than major DEX competitors<\/li>\n<li>Being a decentralized protocol, and not taking direct revenue from trading fees, we are able to pass these cash flows to the community in a very substantial manner. 40% of Fees collected is aimed to be paid out for the Referral Program and Robinhood Pool<\/li>\n<li>Truly Deflationary Token model. Our system of Fees redistribution and settlement of payments in DXLN is designed to greatly push up a token price. Traders, referrals, ambassadors and hodlers, will be able to directly profit from this design<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We are planning to promote 5 fundamental pillars outlined above by constructing an<em><strong> effective and transparent referral and ambassador system<\/strong><\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>The Dexilon Referral Program<\/h2>\n<p>The Dexilon Referral Program is designed to reward users who bring new traders to the platform. Users can receive up to 40% of the commission collected from their referrals, paid back to them every 30-day epoch.<\/p>\n<p>This is one of the most generous referral campaigns on the market, made possible by our well-designed fee structure.<\/p>\n<p>Another great incentive program for small traders is the Robinhood Pool. 10% of all taker fees collected will be distributed to the smallest group of traders, based on trading volume. If you trade below 100k volume per month, you will receive extra cashback for your taker volume.<\/p>\n<p>The referral program and the Robinhood pool work together seamlessly, as groups of traders can join the platform and receive a portion of each other&#8217;s costs, as well as cashbacks from the Robinhood pool, filled by fees from all user groups. Essentially, larger traders incentivize smaller traders to join and provide liquidity, while the smaller traders receive financial benefits from the Robinhood pool.<\/p>\n<h2>Ambassador program<\/h2>\n<p>Carefully designed system is developed to create a loyal community and motivate the community to provide various services to promote and expand Dexilon reach. Some of the examples ambassador work:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Educational work &#8211; teaching communities how to trade at Dexilon and how not to pay ex<\/li>\n<li>Content creation<\/li>\n<li>100+ referrals<\/li>\n<li>Bug bounties<\/li>\n<li>Regional coverage<\/li>\n<li>Meet ups<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Detailed ambassador program via the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1SM8mJHR969dQ_81JUsIpWdjW2a84F0ANQaWawK-AzSA\/edit?pli=1#heading=h.cmbj6ywaw2bt\">link<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Gamification<\/h2>\n<p>Typical problem we are looking to solve with the gamification, is that average user struggle to effectively navigate inside the DEX, when it first lands and then consequently drops.<\/p>\n<p>We have partnered with an external SF based company to develop a Gamification solution, which is aimed to increase user stickiness and LTV.<\/p>\n<p>Gamification at Dexilon is a set of visual quizzes and games inside the trading application, aimed to show, teach and support newcomers on how to efficiently use the platform and incur less mistakes and increase their experience.<\/p>\n<h2>Data terminal<\/h2>\n<p>We introduce a brand new concept of Data Terminal, which cannot be found anywhere else.<\/p>\n<p>Data Terminal is an aggregated data sets which form trading indications from the biggest CeFi and DeFi venues. Users will be able to understand crypto market patterns by accessing real-time data on OrderBook Liquidity across all major exchanges, Sentiment Analysis on current affairs, correlations between stock indexes and various trading pairs, Analytics on relationship of Gas Prices vs Price of the Underlying Asset and much more.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this important? Majority of retail customers, who trade derivatives, predominantly execute technical intra day trading strategies. They often lack sophisticated data about the very fragmented crypto market. Their strategies rely on intra day events, which they largely miss or have to pay substantial costs for the data and then execute the trade elsewhere. We are breaking this. At Dexilon users will have the most up to date and relevant information on liquidity, spreads, macro events in one place, while being able to directly execute trade at Dexilon Exchange. This is a tool which provides traders with the wide range of abilities like searching for walls of resistance or support through a depth chart which aggregates data throughout most popular exchanges. The terminal may provide many hints like how BTC price might act if there are 3 times more volume in asks than bids; provide an info real time about all listings\/delistings so traders might profit from such events and much more.<\/p>\n<p>The terminal opens a wide range of communication opportunities for Dexilon, as news related to exchanges are usually boring. With the terminal, Dexilon will have a much bigger variety of tools aimed to engage a community like rewards for proposing new graphs, finding new correlations which might impact crypto price and so on.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-786\" src=\"https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Untitled2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"971\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Untitled2.png 971w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Untitled2-300x160.png 300w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Untitled2-768x409.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px\" \/> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-787\" src=\"https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Untitled3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"972\" height=\"513\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Untitled3.png 972w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Untitled3-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Untitled3-768x405.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Target Promotional Channels:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investors and partners community channels &#8211; organic<\/li>\n<li>Influence marketing &#8211; paid<\/li>\n<li>AMA sessions, Twitter Spaces<\/li>\n<li>SEO &#8211; organic<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Current Status:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEO is fully operational.

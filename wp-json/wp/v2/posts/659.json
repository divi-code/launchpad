Just scroll down to the next section, if you\u2019re already well-versed in that topic.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cryptocurrency exchange is a platform where you can buy and\/or sell crypto assets, like BTC or DOT. You might have had some experience with regular trading platforms, and crypto exchanges function quite similarly to them. Some exchanges offer advanced trading features like derivatives trading. For example, Dexilon provides its users with the ability to trade crypto options, crypto futures, and also some exotic derivatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a list of the TOP decentralized exchanges:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dexilon \u2013 Best DEX for Crypto Derivatives<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bisq \u2013 Best DEX for Smaller Trades<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dYdX \u2013 Best Exchange for Margin Trading<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PancakeSwap \u2013 Best DEX for New Crypto Assets<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uniswap \u2013 Largest Decentralized\u00a0 Exchange<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you wonder what are the types of crypto exchanges, there are roughly two of them \u2013\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dexilon.io\/company-and-product\/can-decentralized-exchanges-compete-with-centralized-ones-here-are-the-challenges-for-dexs-to-overcome-in-order-to-compete\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">centralized and decentralized exchanges<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and we\u2019re going to focus on the second one in this article. But let us describe both of them briefly to compare.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best decentralized Bitcoin exchanges \u2013\u00a0is it better to choose a DEX or a CEX?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This part might not be helpful for those who have already decided on either of the two types of crypto exchanges, but if you still try to decide if you should choose the best decentralized bitcoin exchange or the best centralized one, here are the main distinctions between them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Centralized exchanges<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (CEXs) are controlled by an organization. One of the biggest advantages of centralized exchanges is that they allow users to trade their fiat currency like EUR or USD into crypto assets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a user of the CEX, you will have to go through the KYC (Know Your Customer) process. This means that before you get to exchange your crypto, you will have to get verified by the platform which involves providing them with your personal information, like your address and ID details. This KYC policy is aimed at tackling cyberattacks and securing everyone\u2019s assets. However, the money being held by a centralized entity inevitably puts it at risk of being stolen by hackers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, the majority of crypto trading transactions are being performed on centralized exchanges. Primarily because this type of exchange appeared first. However, it has some disadvantages, including security issues, which became the reason why decentralized exchanges appeared on the market over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Decentralized exchanges<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (DEX) are much more autonomous than centralized exchanges. They run on smart contracts, and computer protocols that execute, control, and document transactions under specific circumstances. DEXs allow anonymity and flexibility for users since there are usually no KYC requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you hold your crypto on a centralized exchange, it takes control of your funds. With the DEX though, you stay in control of your assets and, thus, this is considered a safer way to trade crypto. With most DeFi exchanges, you trade directly from the wallet connected to the platform. One of the biggest downsides of decentralized exchanges is that you won\u2019t be able to exchange your fiat currency for crypto, so you need to hold some crypto in your crypto wallet, like MetaMask before you try to exchange it for the other currency on the platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s proceed to learn about the biggest benefits of the best decentralized exchanges.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best decentralized crypto exchanges \u2013\u00a0what are their advantages?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges have several benefits that make them more and more attractive to users. Take a look at the list below.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>The range of assets available.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> One of the biggest perks of DEXs is that you usually get access to a tremendous number of coins. It\u2019s much easier to add new coins to a decentralized exchange, as centralized ones require going through a complicated verification process. So new coins usually emerge much faster on decentralized exchanges and before this coin grows in price, you can be one of the lucky dogs, who gets it for a very reasonable price.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Anonymity and better privacy<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. DEXs usually don\u2019t follow a KYC protocol, so you do not need to submit your personal data to a decentralized exchange, so your data won\u2019t be stolen or violated.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Much lower fees<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The exchange does not hold your assets as an intermediary, which means that there\u2019s less work involved on their side, so the fees are usually lower.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decentralized exchanges were created as a response to the restrictions of the centralized ones and made them available to a wider audience of crypto enthusiasts and, despite their own limitations, they are gaining more popularity. Since there\u2019s a huge number of decentralized exchanges these days, you need to know the most important criteria to choose the best dex cryptocurrency exchange available on the market. Keep reading to learn more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best DEX exchanges \u2013 the criteria for choosing a perfect platform you won\u2019t regret joining<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When choosing the best dex crypto exchanges, you need to be aware of what you should be looking at. To be able to separate the wheat from the chaff, there are roughly 7 factors you need to check to make sure the platform is reliable and legit. You are free to prioritize them depending on your needs and preferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Fees and their transparency<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Fees are never a pleasant thing, but they are deeply frustrating if they eat up a lump sum of your rewards. So make sure you study the fees of the exchange you\u2019re choosing before you invest any money. If the platform doesn\u2019t openly describe its fees, it\u2019s automatically a red flag \u2013 you came to DeFi for transparency, didn\u2019t you?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Security<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Even though your money is not held by the exchange, it\u2019s essential to choose an exchange that takes safety seriously. Cybercriminals are evolving along with security measures, so choose an exchange that uses the latest and most reliable achievements of security software.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Supported coins. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re into trying new assets, and it\u2019s important for you to be able to trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies, you should look for a platform that supports a wide range of coins. However, if you\u2019re one of those who prefer to let others test the waters, and usually stick to the trusted assets, choose any of the five exchanges below, they have more than enough.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Payment methods.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s important when you can buy crypto using a convenient way of payment. Especially, if you\u2019re new to crypto, it\u2019s important to have at least a small area where you know what to do and how to do it. So look for an exchange that supports the most suitable payment method personally for you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Customer service<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Seems like one of the least important factors on the list, but, believe me, you don\u2019t want to have an indifferent person on the line or, which is even worse, didn\u2019t get any response when you have some issues with your transactions.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Customer reviews<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I doubted if I have to write it because that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing right now \u2013\u00a0gathering information and trying to figure out what is the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/icoholder.com\/blog\/5-best-decentralized-exchanges-in-2022-that-are-worth-signing-up-for-by-the-end-of-the-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best decentralized exchange for crypto<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The taker fee ranges from 1,5 to 5 bps, whereas there is a rebate of 1 bps. 20% of this difference is an oracle reward.

Here Are the Challenges for DEX&#8217;s to Overcome in Order to Compete"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve been for a while into the crypto field, sure thing you know what CEXs (centralized exchanges) are. Historically, centralized exchanges date back to the inception of digital <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">currencies. Due to their ease of use, user-friendly interface, and the convenience of trading across multiple blockchains, centralized exchanges remain popular today. These exchanges make it easy to trade tokens because they offer easy fiat to crypto conversions, as well as high volumes of trading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/learn\/what-is-a-cex-centralized-exchanges-explained\/#:~:text=Centralized%20exchanges%20(CEXs)%20are%20organizations,Exchanges%20are%20essentially%20marketplaces.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CEXs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> centralized nature allows exchanges to keep full control of their users&#8217; assets. As well, they are prone to cyber-attacks and demand KYC.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DEXs: Challenges for DEXs to Overcome to Become Powerful Competitors to CEXes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is dex (decentralized exchange),it is a platform that provides the ability to exchange one cryptocurrency for another, provide liquidity for other exchanges, as well as engage in staking and farming.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/learn\/what-is-a-dex-how-decentralized-crypto-exchanges-work\/#:~:text=Decentralized%20crypto%20exchanges%20(DEXs)%20are,crypto%20assets%20between%20many%20users.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decentralized exchanges<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are those with no central third party. It means that no one controls the operations of the exchange.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On centralized exchanges, a company manages the order books, user accounts, and everything else involved. Contrary, on decentralized exchanges, these details are handled by smart contracts, which execute functions automatically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s see how DEXs work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AMMdroids: What are the functions of DEXs?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What role does the internal exchange play? What is the process for sending money from your wallet in the form of one token, and for receiving another?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AMMs, or automated market makers, represent decentralized exchanges (DEX) that use mathematical formulas to price assets. In contrast, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nextrope.com\/en\/dex-vs-cex-choosing-the-best-solution-for-your-crypto-exchange\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">centralized exchanges<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (CEX) use an order book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some way, an AMM is similar to an order book exchange as there are trading pairs \u2013 for example, ETH\/USDT. The difference in-between centralized vs decentralized exchanges\u00a0 is that on DEXs the trade can be made without a counterparty (another trader) on the other side. As an alternative to that, you deal with a smart contract that &#8220;creates&#8221; the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can compare an automated market maker to an android that\u2019s always willing to offer a price between two assets. For example, you can connect your Metamask browser wallet to the most popular DEX &#8211; Uniswap, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform will immediately route all exchange operations through your wallet. One currency will be debited, the other credited. No additional steps are required!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the main benefit of AMMs?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.in\/cryptocurrency\/news\/what-is-dex-decentralised-exchanges-give-investors-more-control-and-more-profit\/articleshow\/86164969.cms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AMMs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not only allow you to trade trustlessly, but they also give you an opportunity to become the house and provide liquidity to the liquidity pools. In this way, you can become a representative of a market maker on an exchange and provide liquidity in return for fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to how easy and simple they are to use, AMMs have really carved out their niche in the DeFi space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the weak points of DEXs?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though DEXs are beneficial, they have a few drawbacks. Thus, they are limited by the transaction capability of their networks. When volume rises, so do the fees for executing trades. This has become a major problem for DEXs, many of which are hosted on Ethereum and use an automated market maker (AMM) to manage their trading.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What solutions can DEXs bring?<br \/>\n<\/span><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-382\" src=\"https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/rm373batch4-07-10-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1366\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/rm373batch4-07-10-1.png 2400w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/rm373batch4-07-10-1-300x171.png 300w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/rm373batch4-07-10-1-1024x583.png 1024w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/rm373batch4-07-10-1-768x437.png 768w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/rm373batch4-07-10-1-1536x874.png 1536w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/rm373batch4-07-10-1-2048x1166.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px\" \/><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DEXs were developed as a solution to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/hackernoon\/cex-vs-dex-which-crypto-exchange-model-is-best-1dfcf80f4221\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CEXs\u2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> problems and to give you and other users a true sense of ownership of their assets. DEXs eliminate the intermediary (a centralized authority), replacing it with an automated protocol. Here you have complete control of their assets, unprecedented levels of security, and neither registration nor KYC procedure is required.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For DEXs to compete with their centralized counterparts, they need to solve the following problems:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High fees<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long wait times<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Derivatives trading<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difficulty dealing with high trade volumes<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At present, most DEXs use an AMM and run on the Ethereum network. This model doesn\u2019t scale well, as evidenced by the insanely high gas fees that users wind up having to pay. But there is a solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s possible for a DEX to employ a limit order book rather than an AMM. DEXs can also run on a layer-2 like Polygon. This model allows for more trading volume with lower fees and faster transaction times.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While an AMM can work just fine for trading coins with small market caps and lower overall trading volumes, the system suffers when trying to process large volumes or derivatives trades.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s clear that the solution involves:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a DEX on a layer-2<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A classic limit order book model<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shorter transaction times and lower fees.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-383\" src=\"https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Banner-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Banner-1.png 2400w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Banner-1-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Banner-1-1024x683.png 1024w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Banner-1-768x512.png 768w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Banner-1-1536x1024.png 1536w, https:\/\/dexilon.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Banner-1-2048x1365.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do the Solutions DEXs Can Bring are not Valuable?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of new users won\u2019t be able to trade on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blockchainhub.net\/blog\/blog\/centralised-vs-decentralised-cryptocurrency-exchanges\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DEXs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since it requires complex knowledge. They also don\u2019t support fiat currency transactions, making liquidity challenging. Consequently, users who choose a DEX lose out on the convenience of a CEX. Choosing a CEX, however, they lose control of their assets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, many users lose money while using DEXs on public networks: their assets can be stolen when they sign transactions. Thus, people need to be more careful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One more stumbling rock is wallets safety. There is a demand for more secure solutions and more protected wallets than Metamask, but this comes with a cost. Secure solutions mean that people do not have access to secret keys, so they rely heavily on the wallet counterparty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last but not least are the GAS fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Gas and Why Does it Make DEX\u2019s so Expensive?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gas is the fuel for transactions happening on Ethereum. Each transaction, including actions executed by smart contracts (such as trades carried out on a DEX), requires a small amount of Ether (ETH). Gas fees are measured in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/g\/gwei-ethereum.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gwei<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the smallest units of ETH.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a DEX, trades can take longer and require higher fees when the network gets congested. In addition, the longer it takes for an AMM to update its prices, the wider the spread between buyers and sellers will be, increasing user costs even further.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s an example of how high gas fees can be problematic: In July 2021, the ShapeShift platform airdropped<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2021\/07\/14\/shapeshift-to-shut-down-airdrop-fox-tokens-to-decentralize-itself-out-of-existence\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 340 million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of its FOX tokens to over 900,000 former ShapeShift users and about 120,000 users of different DeFi protocols.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone who used ShapeShift, along with some users of various DeFi platforms like Yearn, Uniswap, Gitcoin and others, all received FOX tokens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sounds great, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only one problem arose here \u2013 gas fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why are Ethereum Gas Fees High? Airdrops and Useless Awards<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To claim the airdrop, users had to pay a gas fee to receive the tokens. If this was all a user wanted to do, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. But what if someone wanted to trade FOX for a different token and then move it to another wallet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, that would incur two additional fees: one for the token swap on the ShapeShift platform and another for sending a transaction off of the DEX.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In mid-July 2021 when the airdrop was announced, the average gas fee price was about 45 gwei. The price for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cryptopotato.com\/ethereum-gas-fees-at-an-8-month-low-as-interest-in-nfts-defi-wanes\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 ETH<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was about $1,880. At the time, that means that one gwei equaled less than one one-thousandth of a penny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the cost for transactions should have been cheap, or so one might think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But in practice, a DEX transaction isn\u2019t so simple. And the gas price as measured in gwei only covers a single function in one smart contract. These transactions can involve many functions occurring in multiple contracts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHow bad could it get?\u201d, you might be thinking. The answer is: pretty bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To claim the FOX airdrop in 2021 cost users close to 20 USD in ETH. Then, if they wanted to swap for another token on the platform, say, USDC, it would have cost another 20 USD. And finally, to transfer an ERC-20 token such as USDC to another wallet would cost yet another 20 USD (approximately).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all that, if a user had been airdropped <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/protos.com\/crypto-airdrop-tries-cover-ethereum-gas-fees-fails-miserably\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">400 USD<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> worth of FOX, they would have lost about 15% of those tokens due to gas fees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, users can borrow money to leverage their positions, lend money to earn interest passively, or provide liquidity to collect fees through decentralized exchanges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since these platforms are built on self-executing smart contracts, they could have a greater number of uses in the future. As an example of how innovation in the decentralized finance sector can lead to products and services that were not previously possible, flash loans refer to loans taken and repaid in a single transaction.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can centralized vs decentralized exchanges compete?

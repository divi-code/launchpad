The trust in crypto has shaken leading to\u00a0multiple crypto assets dropping in price. And here they come again \u2013 crypto naysayers telling us again that crypto is just a big scam. Is that so? Let\u2019s take a look at the facts and figure out if the notorious FTX story unfolding right now means that crypto is doomed (If you don\u2019t have time to read the whole post, here\u2019s the summary: NO).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened and why the crypto market looks like the city after the earthquake?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTX, that used to be one of the biggest players in the crypto market, became insolvent in just a few days dragging the whole crypto market down with prices of tokens sinking drastically. But what happened? Here\u2019s the recap.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backstory<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Binance used to be FTX\u2019s early investor in 2019. Back then, CZ and SBF looked like bros that help and support each other. But then they suddenly broke up in 2021 when FTX bought out Binance\u2019s remaining shares in the company. Binance received a big share of ~$2.1b in FTT (FTX\u2019s token) and since then they became \u201csomebody that I used to know\u201d for each other and their CEOs never missed a chance to take shots at each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Escalation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last Recently, Coindesk has published an article about Alameda research, SBF\u2019s trading company revealing that Alameda research holds $14b in assets and $8b are liabilities. What was shocking, $8b out of $14b were FTT holdings and a few billions worth of Solana. Obviously, nobody else could provide such a loan using FTT collateral apart from FTX (the exchange holds the biggest share of FTT). CZ figured out that FTX\u2019s position is shaky, and made his blow by announcing an intention to sell off his FTT holdings. Thus, destroying the value of a collateral and putting Alameda at a margin call. CZ\u2019s twit was enough for FTT to drop by 35% overnight! People started panicking and tried to get rid of FTT, but nobody was there to buy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon, it became obvious to the public that FTX is at risk, so people started taking money out of FTX.\u00a0 At some point, the exchange couldn\u2019t facilitate users\u2019 requests due to the shortage of liquidity. Just when people calmed down a bit and the withdrawals slowed down, Binance informed that they intended to buy FTX \u201cto save them.\u201d However, in less than a day, we find out that Binance backed up on buying FTX: \u201cBinance is strongly leaning toward scrapping FTX rescue takeover after first glance at books.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTX was worth $30b just a few months ago\u2026 and now, out of the blue, it\u2019s insolvent. There are still many details to be discovered, but we know one thing for sure: FTT, the FTX\u2019s token, was inappropriately used as collateral to borrow against As a result, FTX reportedly ended up with a $10b hole in its balance sheet with the SEC and the Department of Justice investigating the case. Apparently, FTX has suspended all the withdrawals and the onboarding of new clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the consequences?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No wonder we see quite devastating aftermath in the past days of the unfolding FTX drama (and we expect the ripple effect to last for a while):<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency prices started sinking like stones: BTC: -16.1%, ETH: -24.1%, MATIC: -26.9%, SOL: -43.0%.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owing $8-12b to their users, FTX tried to raise money for liquidity. No wonder they haven\u2019t been able to do it \u2013\u00a0with such bad reputation, they\u2019re hardly worth that much. So FTX, FTX group (130 affiliated companies), and Alameda Research have all started filing for bankruptcy on Friday. The whole FTX Ventures team quit, including the CEO.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uncertainty also hangs over Solana, like the sword of Damocles: it relies heavily on FTX for its value. Now when the exchange is going down, it is unknown whether bitcoins traded on the blockchain will be retrievable.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galaxy disclosed they lost $76M, and Genesis Trading reported a $175m loss.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sam, FTX\u2019s CEO, also owns 10% of Robinhood, so we might be seeing some consequences for the company as well.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On late Friday, FTX reported that they have been hacked losing about $600m. It is rumored that someone from the management took the money, especially due to the fact that \u201chackers\u201d allegedly had access to both website and apps.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The centralized crypto world has been having rough times this week. CZ reportedly wrote an email to the Binance team saying that he\u2019s not happy at all about FTX going down, since what happened will affect the whole market. But let\u2019s take a look at what it can mean to the DeFi share of the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How different are DEXs, and why are they immune to such issues?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A centralized exchange is a blackbox \u2013\u00a0its users can see only the data that exchange wants them to see. What\u2019s more, despite the increased levels of security, big centralized exchanges are at risk of being hacked, too. You can deposit your money to a wallet, buy some crypto and wake up to see your wallet balance show up as $0 one day, like FTX users on Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its nature, decentralized exchanges are far more transparent than centralized exchanges. A DEX can\u2019t misuse your money because they won\u2019t have access to it. Thus, one of the biggest advantages of DEXs is their self-custody that allows you to be in possession of your assets. With an exchange like Dexilon, you will have full control over your funds. You will be depositing your assets to the smart contract, thus, they will not be stored on the platform and can\u2019t be secretly used by the exchange for its own purposes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the security, decentralized exchanges can also be hacked, just like traditional ones. However, the level of safety depends on the measures taken by the platform individually. For example, Dexilon is currently under auditing of a top tier security firm called Hacken. Dexilon is designed to be as fast and efficient as top centralized exchanges, but when using Dexilon, users can be confident in the exchange\u2019s solvency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Centralized exchanges usually sell off users&#8217; positions using their own algorithms, or outsource this process. Obviously, this is not transparent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the crypto winter, things have been rough already, with prices dropping and companies laying down employees, and it is expected that it\u2019ll last a little longer than expected because of this incident. But rough times like these are also the best times to build. If you believe in crypto no matter how raging the storm is and will make wise decisions, you can rise high on the next wave. It definitely takes time to find the best practices, so use the situations like this to learn from others\u2019 mistakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>UPDATE (November 25\/2022)<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As another week passes, we get more details about the notorious FTX case and its impact on the crypto market. Let\u2019s take a look at several facts we\u2019ve learned about it since last week:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTX\u2019s balance sheet that SBF sent to the potential investors was leaked showing ~ $9 billion in liabilities and over $1 billion in liquid crypto assets. Also, $5.4 billion in assets were labeled as \u201cless liquid\u201d and $3.2 billion were called \u201cilliquid\u201d. Thus, FTX\u2019s accounting was either poorly executed or fraudulent. While the total amount of liquid and \u201cless liquid\u201d assets is still not equal to liabilities, many of the \u201cless liquid assets\u201d can turn out to be totally illiquid.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week FTX\u2019s 30-page bankruptcy filing was released. Here are some of the highlights: FTX didn\u2019t have any cash management and customer deposit records. What\u2019s more, they used software to hide the misuse of their users\u2019 funds. They didn\u2019t have any employee records, nor did they have any board meetings. FTX created a \u201csecret exemption\u201d for Alameda to bypass the auto-liquidation protocol in the platform.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given all the turmoil around Genesis and Grayscale, Barry Silbert, founder, and CEO of DCG wrote a note to the shareholders trying to calm them down. The investors&#8217; unrest was caused by the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report that Genesis has been trying to raise $1b before suspending some withdrawals. There were reports claiming that Genesis was about to file for bankruptcy. However, the company refuted the claims.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading volumes on decentralized exchanges grew by 11% since the FTX fall. Twitter is full of statements about the importance of DeFi. For instance, Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, said that \u201cthe message is clear: people are realizing that we must return to decentralization and to self-custody.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the case proves that what happened wasn\u2019t a crypto issue. Rather, it was a corruption issue. In this case, we can\u2019t blame crypto or the blockchain because it was a con man who used crypto to trick people and steal their money. That\u2019s why the cryptocurrency market is still there and people are still trading crypto coins, while many of them are turning their heads towards DeFi.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are few crypto folks left who haven\u2019t heard anything about the FTX collapse in the past couple of days.
